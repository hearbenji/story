* glPortal/Cog in the machine: design ideas

** Testing elements
- Portals (eh!)
  * See how it keeps forward momentum, /or/, /to be more precise/, /how it does not/.
- Boxes
  * Constructed in-place (materialization or assembly, the latter is harder to animate but way cooler)
- Lasers
  * Red laser is for the weak, has short wavelength. Give us blue/purple lasers!
  * Can have speed of light OR be slown down by emitter (see upcoming 3D model)
  * Purple lasers are lethal and can be used to (willingly) damage things, whereas blue ones are not
    (both can be, of course, used to activate laser receivers)
- Laser redirection boxes
- Buttons
  * Player activated (small button)
  * Box activated
- Catapults
  * Target
- Fizzlers
  - Portal-only
  - Object-only
  - Both
  * Visible action surface (another Simplex Noise?) / volume edge
  * Edges visible and surrounded by wall-tied emitters
    * Might be sticking out of the wall or part of it

** Other design-related things
- Show connection between elements by lines on the wall
  * Show logical operations using their respective MIL/ANSI symbol,
    plus its short name (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, NOT) inside the symbol
    (because not everyone knows the symbol)
  * Has a to-be-chosen color when disabled, anoter one when enabled
  * Can have delay and timer gates
    * Must choose symbols
    * Delay/timer written in symbol (e.g. 2s)

** Test series
Some of them are named after scientists/artists

*** Newton series
- Differently weighed boxes
  * Buttons accepting a certain threshold of mass
  * Lever mechanism, to lift things
  * Fun Fact™: Portal 2's cube entity name is =portal_weighted_cube=, which /isn't/ actually weighted
- Gravity fields
  * Changes gravity for a given zone
  * Low/zero gravity
    * Zero-gravity shall not be accessed by the player since it can't really swim in air...
- Projected gravity fields
  * Same as above
  * Projected
  * Gravity goes in the projection direction
    * Can be reversed/stop or even faster/slower
  * Can go through portals
  * Has velocity cap
- Zero-G boxes
  * May be activated/deactivated by areas and/or special lasers (including slowed down ones)

*** (Nikola) Tesla series
- Magnetic boxes
  * Positively charged: red aspect, white "+" on it
  * Negatively charged: blue/cyan aspect, white "-" on it
  * Can be more or less polarized, indicated by color intensity or a "gauge" on it
  * Of course, they repel themselves
- Magnetic surfaces?
- Magnetic buttons

*** Elemental series
- Water/other liquid  - !! Requires specific test chamber design to avoid too much sandboxing if the flow simulation is costly !!
  * Could be poured by portals from a container/dispenser to fill some areas requiring fill-up as part of the test
  * Use drains to limit liquid quantity
  * Physical simulation shouldn't be an actual particle simulation but rather a volume box simulation
    using a simple pathfinding algorithm to determine where to go
  * Maybe use Bullet-FLUIDS? https://github.com/rtrius/Bullet-FLUIDS
- Fire & hot Air
  * Can make wooden objects catch fire to clean a path
  * Its hot air effect (non-physically simulated, but still visually displayed using particles) could lift things (c.f. hot air balloons)
- Air ducts
  * Blow air or suck air, can be used to attract/repel objects
- Earth? Give ideas.
- Heat/cold beams (maybe?)
  * Could lead to funny mechanics like triggering fire, making water boil/freeze it
    * Making water boil to evaporate it, as testing element
    * Freezing electrified, albeit deadly, water to be able to walk on it

*** Wavelength series
- Colored Boxes for use with ↓
- Colored Box Button

- White/colored lasers
  * Has a limited set of colors:
      [Color] [RGB]
    - Red      100
    - Yellow   110
    - Green    010
    - Cyan     011
    - Blue     001
    - Purple   101
    - White    111
- Colored Laser reditection boxes
  * Acts as light filter; e.g. red laser doesn't pass through green box which only lets green pass
- Laser reditection boxes, colored or not:
  * When combining multiple laser colors, they RGB-ically combine (e.g. Red+Cyan=White)
  * Already-imposed restrictions still applies for colored redirection boxes
- Prism?
  * Splits out laser into its R, G, B components
- Colored laser receiver
  * Can be activated by a combination of wavelengths/RGB components,
    though multiple activators are to be used only in most advanced tests
- !!! On lasers: keep lethality or not? Rule(s) which defines it? !!!

*** Multiplicity series
- Multiple portal pairs (isn't good for colorblind people)
  * Linked portals have almost the same color:
    - Red/Orange
    - Yellow/Lime
    - Green/Blue-Green or Cyan
    - Blue/Violet

*** Escher series
- Noneucliean space: have (invisible) world-portals
  * Might, by far, be the hardest thing to implement because of implications (LOD, portal rendering, ...)
- Space bending corridors
- Big combination with gravity fields

*** Tag series
- Paint fluids
  * If Elemental series' water pouring mecanics gets implemented, can be used with paint as liquid, for storage only parts
    * Could spice up gameplay by limiting amount of paint; but resetting involves tricky things, pick one:
      - Level restart (through disintegrating you? Or through escape ways to cloned test chamber?)
      - Reset button: go to the test's start point, press reset button, water sprayers washes out paint, boxes fizzled, game mechanics' states reset
  - Speed
  - Surface-convert (nonportallable → portallable)
  - Laser-reflect

*** Ultimate/OCD series
- Any of the above, combined
  * "Any", possibly "All", but don't go too far
  * Not necessarily complicated, but complex (refer to the Python lore; run your Python interpreter and type "import this")
    * Actually, try to avoid complicated levels, keep the fun

Chronos series? (wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff)

** Other random ideas
- "Matrix" mode: see some things through walls
- Self-destructing box
  * Countdown displayed on it
- Spheres
  * Essentially the same as boxes, but it's a sphere
  * Sphere button
- Tetrahedrons
  * Serves the same purpose as boxes/spheres 
  * Constructed in-place by folding and soldering its net
  * Tetrahedron buttons
- Jello boxes / spheres / tetrahedrons
  * Constructed in-place by pouring liquid jello in a transparent (e.g. plastic or glass) mold and then quicky being cooled
  * Bouncy!
  * Available in different colors, for the cheap price of $0.00 !
  * Dissolved when it goes in water
